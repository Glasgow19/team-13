# Lucky 13

A web application created with Flask for JP Morgan's Code for Good Hackathon 2019 in Glasgow. Code for Good is different in the sense that the aim of the hackathon is to provide software solutions for non-profilt organziations and to give back to the community.

## Challenge
The challenge was to create a technological solution that would find data on why people don't excercise.

## Solution
Our solution was to create a web application that would check the user's calendar using the Google calendar API and from there it would recommend exercises/sports that they could do depending on their schedule and interests. This data was compiled and recommendations shown to the user on the interface of the app. In terms of providing data on why people don't exercise, we hooked into the Twitter and Gmail API to see if people spend a lot of time on social media/sending emails at work.
